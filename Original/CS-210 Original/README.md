# Cppproject Cali Mullen

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  The project was to create a clock for a computer screen. This clock was 12 hour and 24 hour and could be adjusted accordingly.

# What did you do particularly well?
  I focused a lot of my efforts in making sure the displays design was neat and readable to the user. When writing my code, I separated it by methods to make it more consise and easier to read by other programmers.
  
# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
Using a class for the clock methods would have made the code more secure, readable, and efficient.

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Personally, I found the most challenging part to be having to increment the times to reset once the minutes and seconds reached :59 and the hours reached 12 or 24, depemding on the clock.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Being able to write and understand methods and how they work in c++. These skills can be transfered to other languages to help make codes more consise. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I included comments throghout to descibe what each method does and how the program runs. This allows other programmers to understand what is happening in the code or where to find a certain aspect within.

# Self Assessment
My name is Cali Mullen. I am currently 25 years old as I finish my final courses here at SNHU. I started my journey with SNHU in October of 2020. I decided that I wanted to act and control the outcome of my life, and a degree is a great opportunity to accomplish that. I wanted to have options and added opportunities that come with having a bachelor’s degree in today’s world. 

Throughout my career at SNHU, I have learned so many important things that I will take with me into all future career endeavors. Specifically, I learned the importance of having a strong and organized project management team and the correlation between strong management and strong project result. I learned how to effectively plan and develop a project using the project lifecycle and effectively and regularly test my project to mitigate risks. I developed a deep understanding of databases and the immense impact they have on every single facet of life. Health, Technology, and entertainment all have strong ties to databases and developmental ideologies that are often overlooked. Finally, I grew an understanding of coding and developing projects using programming languages like python, c++, and java and the pros and cons to each. Java specializes in Object-Oriented programming, C++ provides complete control over memory management, and python is an easy starting language for beginners looking to learn more about coding and development. 

## Team Environments and Communication with Stakeholders
When developing a project, including stakeholders in all phases of development is essential for the overall success of the project. Stakeholders all have different wants and viewpoints, so they provide feedback that is internal, but also it is critical to deliver a successful product. Additionally, working alongside team members will help provide consistent feedback that promotes a positive work environment. Additionally, working with consistent collaboration allows team members to learn and grow together and expand their skills and knowledge alongside each other while solving the projects problems. 

The EPortfolio will showcase my skills that I have learnt during my time at SNHU, and I will apply them to different artifacts that I have chosen to enhance them to really show case my skills in three distinct areas which include: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures and Databases.

## Chosen Artifacts
The first artifact I have chosen to enhance was from a course that I completed in the past, CS210, which was my first C++ course. This was where I learned the basics of the language and developed a console application that will display a 12 hour and 24-hour clock. I chose this artifact because it was the first course that made me start to think about software and design. This course was also where I learned fundamentals of most programming languages including functions, classes and objects and it further developed my understanding of object orientated programming languages. Therefore, this was a great artifact to enhance to show case my Software Design and Engineering skills.

The other artifact that I had chosen was from the course CS-360. During my time in this course, I was able to understand the importance of databases, design, and security. I worked with SQLite during the mobile development to store user information and security to ensure that no malicious actors could obtain the information. This artifact enhancement was an opportunity to showcase my Data Structures and Algorithms and Databases skills.

# Enhancment 1: Software Design and Engineering
## Original artifact
This artifact was an assignment I created during my CS-210 course at SNHU. This artifact was a project that required the creation of a 12 and 24- hour clock. The time could be set by the hour, minute, and second by the user and would be displayed as set to the console.
The original code can be found here:[https://github.com/calimullen/calimullen.github.io/tree/main/Original/CS-210%20Original]

## Why I chose this artifact
The skill I wanted to demonstrate using this artifact is that I am able to reverse engineer an old project and be able to translate it into another language. I find this useful as technology is always evolving in new and different ways, as is programming languages that can become obsolete if they are no longer supported by the creators or the community. Using this skill it helps demonstrate that I can keep up with latest technologies and languages.
Moreover another skill I wanted to demonstrate is the ability to take another project and enhance aspects of it for example taking the c++ project and translating over to Java I can utilize some of the benefits of Java in addition making the code more efficient.

## Meeting course outcomes
The artifact was improved as it is now written in java. The software will be able to run on any operating system without the need to change any of the code. Memory is no longer as big of a priority as java handles that for developers. Which is an advantage over c++ where data is stored on the heap, where it is not automatically deleted if it is no longer needed. This causes issues like memory leaks within the program, making the program more vulnerable to crashes as the memory size can grow exponentially and crash the software.

## Reflection
It was difficult to find a good starting point, however once I found a way to get going, I managed to see the difference on how the two languages have their differences but also similarities on how the interact and with displaying messages to the console and getting inputs from the user.

# Enhancment 2: Algorithms and Data Structures
## Original artifact
This artifact was created during my course in CS360 in which I was tasked to create an app within android studio using the programming language JAVA. The app was to allow the user to keep track of their weight and weight loss progress. Within the app the user was able to create an account and then log-in using their credentials (username and password). Within the backend of the code, SQLite was used to create and store databases that will hold the users credential information and their weight information.
The original code can be found here:[https://github.com/calimullen/calimullen.github.io/tree/main/Original/CS-360%20Original]

## Why I chose this artifact
I chose this artifact because it was an excellent way for me to highlight my ability to expand upon the existing code by introducing more complexity. With the enhancements, I was able to create a new page that was dedicated to the creation of a new account. Furthermore, creating a more suitable UI being easier for the end user to clearly understand what is happening and what is required of them.
In addition, the enhancement also included a sounder data structure where the user is creating a new account that will hold more information. For example, within the enhancement it now requires the user to enter: first and last name, email address, username, and password.
Another skill I was able to highlight was my ability to flawlessly navigate through different pages within the app.

## Meeting course outcomes
I was able to meet the course outcome for this enhancement that I had set out in module one, as I was able to create a better UI experience for the user. However, I do believe I could do more on the weight tracking side of the app by including an edit account button, but I did add to that as part of my Database enhancement. Additionally, I was able to satisfy and hold a more accurate data structure of what the app should gather from the end user.

## Reflection
While I was developing this enhancement the learning curve that I had to manage was “What information” I should gather from the user and was it acceptable for me to ask for certain information. As I could be asking for too much information that may make the user turn away from using my app. In addition, I also saw through research that it is best to inform the user how the data would be used when using the app, again this is to inform the user who may want to know why the app is requiring the data and how it will be used and for privacy and security reasons.

# Enhancment 3: Databases
## Original artifact
This artifact was created during my course in CS360 in which I was tasked to create an app in android studio using the programming language JAVA. The app was designed to allow the user to keep track of their weight and weight loss progress. 
In the app, the user was able to create an account and log-in using their credentials (username and password). In the backend of the code, SQLite was used to create and store databases that will hold the users credential information and their weight information.
The original code can be found here:[https://github.com/calimullen/calimullen.github.io/tree/main/Original/CS-360%20Original]

## Why I chose this artifact
I selected this artifact to enhance because I believed it was a perfect way for me to show case my skill in database and design.  This is because the app heavily utilizes SQLLite to store user information. I was able to edit my design changes of the SQL databases by changing multiple layers. For example, changing what is stored on the table and what is displayed to the user. Additionally, the user is now able to update their information within the app using SQL queries running in the background.

## Meeting course outcomes
I did manage to achieve the course outcomes that I had originally planned as I was able to create more refined SQL queries running in the back end of my app.  I used industry standard practices and changing the information I wanted to store in these databases leading to a more user-friendly robust app for my users.
The app now allows users to sign in using the newly created Create Account page that will store more information than just the username and password. It will now take in their first and last names, email, username and password. This is all stored in the database table called users and each element can be updated within the Edit 

## Reflection
During my time working on enhancing this artifact there were issues I had come across that I required solutions. For example, any database design changes that I have developed in the enhanced version of the app, I would need to apply these changes to existing users who have already downloaded and used the app previously.
Another issue I came across while developing this enhancement came from creating the ‘Edit Account’ page. I had to decide what information I would like the user to update and ensure that any changes to the username or email did not cause conflicts as these fields are the primary key within my database table. 
Finally, once the user has made their changes, I wanted to ensure they entered the correct password in the “old password” text box. This is to ensure that it is the actual user who is requesting to make these changes and not an external malicious user.

# Self Assessment
My name is Cali Mullen. I am currently 25 years old as I finish my final courses here at SNHU. I started my journey with SNHU in October of 2020. I decided that I wanted to act and control the outcome of my life, and a degree is a great opportunity to accomplish that. I wanted to have options and added opportunities that come with having a bachelor’s degree in today’s world. 

Throughout my career at SNHU, I have learned so many important things that I will take with me into all future career endeavors. Specifically, I learned the importance of having a strong and organized project management team and the correlation between strong management and strong project result. I learned how to effectively plan and develop a project using the project lifecycle and effectively and regularly test my project to mitigate risks. I developed a deep understanding of databases and the immense impact they have on every single facet of life. Health, Technology, and entertainment all have strong ties to databases and developmental ideologies that are often overlooked. Finally, I grew an understanding of coding and developing projects using programming languages like python, c++, and java and the pros and cons to each. Java specializes in Object-Oriented programming, C++ provides complete control over memory management, and python is an easy starting language for beginners looking to learn more about coding and development. 

## Team Environments and Communication with Stakeholders
When developing a project, including stakeholders in all phases of development is essential for the overall success of the project. Stakeholders all have different wants and viewpoints, so they provide feedback that is internal, but also it is critical to deliver a successful product. Additionally, working alongside team members will help provide consistent feedback that promotes a positive work environment. Additionally, working with consistent collaboration allows team members to learn and grow together and expand their skills and knowledge alongside each other while solving the projects problems. 

The EPortfolio will showcase my skills that I have learnt during my time at SNHU, and I will apply them to different artifacts that I have chosen to enhance them to really show case my skills in three distinct areas which include: Software Design and Engineering, Algorithms and Data Structures and Databases.

## Chosen Artifacts
The first artifact I have chosen to enhance was from a course that I completed in the past, CS210, which was my first C++ course. This was where I learned the basics of the language and developed a console application that will display a 12 hour and 24-hour clock. I chose this artifact because it was the first course that made me start to think about software and design. This course was also where I learned fundamentals of most programming languages including functions, classes and objects and it further developed my understanding of object orientated programming languages. Therefore, this was a great artifact to enhance to show case my Software Design and Engineering skills.

The other artifact that I had chosen was from the course CS-360. During my time in this course, I was able to understand the importance of databases, design, and security. I worked with SQLite during the mobile development to store user information and security to ensure that no malicious actors could obtain the information. This artifact enhancement was an opportunity to showcase my Data Structures and Algorithms and Databases skills.
